# Calculator

This is a basic calculator app, created using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS, and 
mimicking the MacOS native calculator app. 

The app supports full keyboard support - 1 through 9 for number entry, operator
inputs via +, -, *, and / keys, and Esc and Enter keys for clearing and 
calculating, respectively. 

You can view a live demo of the app at this [link.](https://heykzhao.github.io/top_calculator)
